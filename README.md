## Projects
### Loan Default Prediction and Credit Scoring Model Deployment
This project developed a comprehensive loan default prediction system. It leveraged machine learning to accurately predict the likelihood of borrowers defaulting on their loans, considering factors like borrower characteristics and loan attributes. A robust credit scoring model was built to assess borrower creditworthiness, enabling real-time scoring through a REST API for seamless integration with other systems. The project also emphasized extracting valuable insights from the data to inform product development, risk management, and customer segmentation strategies, ultimately leading to better decision-making and improved business outcomes.
